# Codex Working Rules (Talentexperte)

- Static website (HTML/CSS/JS). No build tools, no frameworks.
- Keep structure: css/, images/, fonts/, pdf/, favicon/.
- Do not rename/move files unless explicitly asked.
- Prefer minimal, readable changes; avoid large refactors.
- Before multi-file edits: state plan and list affected files.
